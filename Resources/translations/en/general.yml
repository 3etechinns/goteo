guide-project-updates: '<b>It''s very important that the projects keep their co-financiers and other potentially interested people up to date about how the campaign is progressing. Use this section like a blog to publish updates about the project.</b>On Goteo, after you''ve achieved the minimum financing, and as you go into the second round, it''s essential to periodically explain how the production, progress, problems, etc. are going in order to allow the most transparency possible in order to generate even more interest and community.'
guide-project-supports: '<strong>In this section you will specify what other support, apart from financing, that you will need in order to complete the project.</strong><br><br>They can consist of collaboration or assistance from other people (translations, organization, promotion, etc.) or perhaps specific loans (of material, transportation, hardware, etc.)'
guide-project-rewards: '<strong>In this section, you should establish what the project is offering to its co-financiers and also what the collective benefits will be.</strong><br><br>In addition to the individual rewards for each level of crowdfunding, you should define the type of license that you will assign to the project, according to its format and/or level of openness (or that of its parts). This is very important, since Goteo is a crowdfunding platform for projects based on a philosophy of open source software and promotion of the common good.<br><br>In the event that in addition to one of the licenses specified here you would also like to register the intellectual property rights of your work or ideas, while maintaining its compatibility with collective benefits, you can get specific legal protection with <a href="http://www.safecreative.org/" target="new">Safe Creative</a>.'
guide-project-costs: '<strong>In this section, you should fill out a short business plan based on the estimated costs for your project.</strong><br><br>You should break down the numbers by tasks, infrastructure, or materials. Try to be realistic about the costs and briefly explain why you need each one. Keep in mind that, as a general rule, the better part of the project will have to be undertaken by the person or team that is promoting the project, and not subcontracted to third parties. For the calculation, also keep in mind the commissions for Goteo''s provision of services and transaction, which add up to around 4''8%-6%, depending on the activation -or not- of the Paypal payment option (<a href="/faq/sponsor#q98" target="new">+ info in our FAQ</a>). <br><br><strong>Very important</strong>: On Goteo, we differentiate between necessary and supplemental costs. The former must be totally covered in order to obtain funding, while the latter can be obtained as part of a second campaign once the project is underway, in order to cover optimization costs (promotion, design, outreach, additional units, etc.) These supplemental costs can not be more than one half of the total cost of the project.'
guide-project-contract-information: '<strong>The only thing left is to fill in your data if you want your project to be co-financed and supported through Goteo.</strong><br><br>The information in this section is necessary so that we can contact you if you get the required financing, and be able to make the deposit. In the case of organizations, we recommend that the representative of the organization be formally accredited (for example, by way of the statutes or a certificate of the secretary with an OK from the president, in the case of associations).'
guide-project-description: '<strong>Use this section to explain the conceptual aspects of the project</strong><br><br>This is the first information that a visitor to the site will see. For that reason, we recommend being careful with editing and avoiding typos. You will see that there are required fields, including one for video and images. We believe that these are essential for starting a campaign to raise funds via Goteo.<br><br>Keep in mind that the most valuable thing to Goteo is: the free information and general knowledge that your project will bring to the community, the originality, the desire to answer a social need, the power to attract a wide community of interested people, making it clear that the promotion team has the capacity and experience to bring the project to fruition. So don''t forget to give us information about all of these points.'
