Plan it by starting at least two months from today, since you have to take into account the time needed for revising the proposal, publicizing it if it is chosen, and the 40 days from the first financing. Don''t include pieces that were developed previously even though these are good to explain in your project''s description. We only want things on the schedule that still need to be done and for which you''re requesting co-financing.'

The first round lasts 40 days, in order to obtain the minimum essential amount. Only those that achieve this level of financing can opt to continue with the second round, for an additional 40 days, in order to achieve the optimal amount of funds. In the second round (in contrast with the first), you get everything you have raised even if you don''t reach the full goal.  '
tooltip-project-cost-required: 'This section is very important: for each expense that you enter, you have to indicate if it is absolutely necessary or just supplemental. All of the expenses that are marked as necessary will be added to get the full amount of minimum financing required for the project. The sum of the supplemental expenses, in contrast, can be requested during the second round of financing, after having gotten the “necessary” funds.'
